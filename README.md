# Core

### Yarn Package Scripts

```json
// yarn run <command> args...

"wallet": "npx ts-node helper/wallet.info.ts",

"compile": "npx hardhat compile",
"test": "npx hardhat test",
"coverage": "npx hardhat coverage",

"deploy": "npx hardhat ignition deploy",
"verify": "npx hardhat verify",

"build": "tsup",
"publish": "npm publish --access public"
```

### 1. Install dependencies

`yarn install`

### 2. Set Environment

> See .env.example

```JSON
file: .env

ALCHEMY_RPC_KEY=...
DEPLOYER_SEED="test test test test test test test test test test test junk"
DEPLOYER_SEED_INDEX=1 // optional, select deployer
ETHERSCAN_API=...
```

> Create new session or re-navigate to the current directory, to make sure environment is loaded from `.env`

### 3. Develop Smart Contracts

> Develop your contracts in the `/contracts` directory and compile with:

```Bash
yarn run compile					# Compiles all contracts
```

### 4. Testing

> All test files are located in /test directory. Run tests using:

```Bash
yarn run test                    	# Run all tests
yarn run test test/Membership.ts 	# Run specific test file
yarn run coverage               	# Generate test coverage report
```

### 5. Write Deployment Scripts (via ignition deploy and verify)

> Deployment modules are located in /ignition/modules. Deploy your contracts:

```Bash
yarn run deploy ignition/modules/Membership.ts --network polygon --verify --deployment-id membership0

--> increase: deployment-id
```

This will:

-   Compile and deploy contracts
-   Verify on Etherscan and Sourcify
-   Generate deployment artifacts in /ignition/deployments

Verify:

-   verifies contract on etherscan
-   verifies contract on sourcify

Key deployment files:

-   deployed_addresses.json: Contains contract addresses
-   journal.json: Detailed deployment logs

-   creates deployment artifacts in /ignition`/deployments` directory
-   creates ./ignition/deployments/[deployment]/`deployed_addresses.json`
-   creates ./ignition/deployments/[deployment]/`journal.jsonl`
-   creates constructor-args in /ignition`/constructor-args` directory, as JS module export

### 5.1 Example

```Bash
âœ” Confirm deploy to network polygon (137)? â€¦ yes

### 5.2 Manual Verify

`npx hardhat verify --network polygon --constructor-args ./ignition/constructor-args/$FILE.js $ADDRESS`

### 6 Prepare NPM Package Support

-   [x] Export ready to use TypeScript ABIs
-   [x] Export ready to use TypeScript deployed address config
-   [ ] ...

### 6.1 TypeScript ABIs

Export contract ABIs for npm package usage by copying the JSON into dedicated TypeScript files:

```TS
file: exports/abis/...

export const StorageABI = [
...
JSON
...
] as const;
```

### 6.2 TypeScript Address Config

Provides a mapping of contract addresses for the Membership and Storage contracts deployed on different blockchain networks.

The `ADDRESS` object contains the contract addresses for the `mainnet` and `polygon` networks, with the network ID as the key.
The `zeroAddress` is used as a placeholder for the `mainnet` network, as the contracts have not been deployed there yet.

```TS
file: exports/address.config.ts

import { mainnet, polygon } from 'viem/chains';
import { Address, zeroAddress } from 'viem';

export interface ChainAddress {
	membership: Address;
	storage: Address;
}

export const ADDRESS: Record<number, ChainAddress> = {
	[mainnet.id]: {
		membership: zeroAddress,
		storage: zeroAddress,
	},
	[polygon.id]: {
		membership: '0x72950A0A9689fCA941Ddc9E1a58dcD3fb792E3D2',
		storage: '0x8A7e8091e71cCB7D1EbDd773C26AD82AAd323328',
	},
};
```

# 7. TSUP and npm package

### 7.1 TSUP

> Config: /tsup.config.ts

TSUP bundles TypeScript code into optimized JavaScript packages. This package uses TSUP to create production-ready builds.

`yarn run build`

### 7.2 NPM Package

> **Increase Version:** Update version number in package.json using semantic versioning (e.g. 0.0.1 -> 0.0.2) before publishing new changes.

```
file: /package.json

"name": "@wrytlabs/core-template",
"version": "0.0.1", <-- HERE
```

Login to your NPM account

`npm login`

This will publish your package to NPM with public access, making it **available for anyone to install and use**.

`yarn run publish`

To publish new version. `publish: "npm publish --access public"`

> **Note**: During npm package publishing, the command may execute twice. The second execution will fail with a version conflict since the package is already published. This is expected behavior and the first publish will have succeeded.

### 7.3 How to transpile package into bundled apps

(not needed, since its already a true JS bundled module)

E.g. for `NextJs` using the `next.config.js` in root of project.

```js
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
	reactStrictMode: true,
	transpilePackages: ['@wrtylabs/core', '@wrytelabs/api'],
};

module.exports = nextConfig;
```
